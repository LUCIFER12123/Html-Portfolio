<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a second-year Computer Engineering student at I²IT. Along with my passion for technology and coding, I actively pursue fitness through regular gym sessions. I enjoy reading books that broaden my perspective and inspire new ideas. Writing is another hobby that allows me to express my thoughts creatively. I’m always eager to learn, grow, and challenge myself both academically and personally.</p>
